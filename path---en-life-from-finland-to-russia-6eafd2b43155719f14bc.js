This was a trip to my husband’s and my hometown\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrozavodsk">Petrozavodsk</a> (Petroskoi in Finnish). Trips to there are quite a challenge\nas the trasport connection is not the best. Apparently the go-by-car option turned out to be the most comfortable. I\nrecommend all my Finnish friends to have such a trip, at least once in a lifetime. You will see the Russian region which\nis far different from the metropolitan Moscow and St. Petersburg. And to do so it worths to get some tips.</p>\n<excerpt/>\n<h2>Why by car?</h2>\n<p>First of all, let me motivate the choice to go by car. This is indeed not the only option. However in my opinion this is\nthe best. You can find other options with\n<a href="http://www.rome2rio.com/ru/s/%D0%A5%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA">Rome2Rio</a>.</p>\n<p>The cheapest and fastest is going by direct bus. They are operated by Russian-based companies, and every day there is a\nbus going back or forth. Sometimes 2 or 3. However the bus trip takes up to 13 hours. If they depart at 8 in the\nmorning, this means arriving at 8 in the evening. So, you will need to spend whole day there. There are also night trips\nfrom 8pm to 8 am. But sleeping in the bus is not the best experience of my life. Usually the next day is all dedicated\nfor rest.</p>\n<p>The buses are comfortable, they provide toilets and blankets. But it is still a bus with not that much space,\nespecially if you get a neighbor. Also, they operate only in Russian, and non-Russian speakers may find difficult to\ncommunicate. However I believe this is still doable.</p>\n<p>The good thing is that busses go through the border with no queue. The border stuff must not take more than an hour for\nall the passengers. You can be sure that you arrive in time.</p>\n<p>Another connection is by train through St. Petersburg. This is more expensive but comfortable. However the needed\ntransfer in St. Petersburg destroys the comfort level. So, I would recommend this only if you are planning to stay there\nfor 2-3 days for some touristy.</p>\n<h2>The route</h2>\n<p>The recommended route from Helsinki region is like that:</p>\n<p>Helsinki — Lahti — Lappeenranta — Kitee — Niirala (cross the border here) — Lyaskelya (Läskelä) — Kolatselga (Kolatselkä) —\nPryazha (Prääsä) — Petrozavodsk (Petroskoi).</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class="gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper"\n            style="padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 2em"\n          >\n            <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m58!1m12!1m3!1d3945977.173735904!2d24.92763507997702!3d61.12398277225209!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m43!3e0!4m5!1s0x46920bc796210691%3A0xcd4ebd843be2f763!2sHelsinki!3m2!1d60.1733244!2d24.941024799999997!4m5!1s0x468e2090ecf624f5%3A0x366ea5de0a7e15d7!2sNeste+Oil+Orimattila+Tuuliharja%2C+Orimattila!3m2!1d60.825630499999995!2d25.5279597!4m5!1s0x4690be3c263e712b%3A0x12804594829a161!2sABC+Viipurinportti+Lappeenranta%2C+Hirsim%C3%A4enkatu%2C+Lappeenranta!3m2!1d61.052775999999994!2d28.260175!4m5!1s0x469bc539bef430b9%3A0x40146d63c75b200!2sKitee!3m2!1d62.0984379!2d30.138004499999997!4m5!1s0x46995f4d08a2a6d3%3A0x62d9b7196c7fc150!2sNiiralan+rajanylityspaikka%2C+Tohmaj%C3%A4rvi!3m2!1d62.1719819!2d30.613665599999997!4m5!1s0x4698c269b1f5e4ff%3A0x63754189a5492f48!2sKolatselga%2C+Republic+of+Karelia%2C+Russia!3m2!1d61.678122599999995!2d32.230222!4m5!1s0x46a1ec3dd7bf1fe7%3A0xe49db0d89a0485d4!2sPetrozavodsk%2C+Republic+of+Karelia%2C+Russia!3m2!1d61.7781617!2d34.3640396!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sfi!4v1444217488751" frameborder="0" style="\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          " allowfullscreen></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p>Your navigator or Google may build another route. Do not believe them.</p>\n<p>Better to go through Lahti than through Porvoo. Numbers say that Porvoo-way is faster. But the difference is only 10\nminutes, whereas road to Lahti has 4 lanes and does not take all the traffic to St. Petersburg. This ensures the fastest\nspeed and more comfortable drive.</p>\n<p>Closer to the border take a short cut through Kitee. After the border take the route to Kolatselga (Kolatselkä). There\nis another road to Petrozavodsk, through Suoyarvi (Suojärvi) which is shorter, but not faster. The roads’ condition in\nRussia is legendary, so it matters to take the better route.</p>\n<h2>The stops</h2>\n<p>Such a long drive requires several stops.

In there you need to present the custom declaration and the car documents. They take one\ncopy and give back another one with a stamp. Having gotten this, drive the car forward to the next line (these 20\nmeters), than open all the doors and the trunk. I also recommend to open the hood. This is not obligatory but can make\nthings faster if they want to look there. The cars are examined, sometimes with a dog. They may ask what is inside the\nsuits. As a result of examination you get another stamp in the custom declaration.

Then the car examination\nwith opening all the doors and a dog (if you are lucky). Having passed the custom control, drive to the border control\nin 20 meter. A driver is allowed to go out of the car only if he or she is first in the queue. Once you are in front of\nthe stop line, leave the car and pass the passport control in the booth.</p>\n<p>Your passengers should leave the car when arriving at the custom control. They go through the building. Once the driver\nhas finished their business, paggengers can be picked up from the side of the road.</p>\n<p>The next stop is the Finnish border control. It goes exactly as on the way in. Stop in front of the bar. Then all the\npeople go through the building for the passport control. The driver also presents the car documents to the officer.\nHaving passed the control, all can sit into the car and drive as the toll barrier is lifted.</p>\n<h2>Time management</h2>\n<p>Our first car jorney took 13 hours one way and 11 hours back. We drived from morning to evening. Now I don’t think that\nthis is a best solution. However the woodland scenery is very nice, sad to spend whole day only for driving. Also, from\nOctober to April it is becoming quite dark when you arrive to the Russian part. The road there is curvy, which is not\nvery comfortable in the darkness.</p>\n<p>The better schedule would be like that:</p>\n<p>Head from Helsinki at 17:00 or a little bit earlier. In 6 hours you are at the border. There must not be a long queue at\nnight, so you will pass it faster. Then you can have rest night in a hotel which you book in advance. This might be the\nhotel in Vyartsilya village right after the border, or something closer to Pitkyaranta (Pitkäranta) if you will stong\nenough to drive 2 more hours.</p>\n<p>In the morning you can make the rest of the drive. With the breakfast at Kolatselga this must take 3-4 hours, which\nmeans that you can arrive by the noon. I belive this is the best option.</p>\n<p>Overnight staying at the Finnish part can be an option as well.</p>\n<p>As for the way back, in the winter time it woulr be better to depart from Petrozavodsk in the morning. So the driving\nwill take a day. However in summer the overnight staying scheme can be used here as well.</p>\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n<p>Bring your car to the Tikkurila station in the morning. Then you can pick it up after the working day and start your\ntrip. This saves 20 minutes and becomes one more reason for going trough Lahti.</p>\n<p>Do not eat long. Half an hour must be the upper limit for your stays.</p>\n<p>Do not bring a lot of petrol in Russia, better take on fuel there. There is a petrol station right after the border. We prefer\nLukoil a little bit father the Jänismäki cafe. Draw the full tank on the way back.</p>',fields:{slug:"en/life/from-finland-to-russia/",prefix:"",disqusIdentifier:"life-from-finland-to-russia-index-en"},frontmatter:{title:"From Finland to Russia by car",date:"08 October 2015",v2:!0,old:null,tumblr:null,meta:null,cover:null}},authornote:{id:"/Users/varya/WebDev/Personal/varya.github.com/content/parts/author.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",html:'<p><strong>Mr. Gatsby</strong> Proin ornare ligula eu tellus tempus elementum.
