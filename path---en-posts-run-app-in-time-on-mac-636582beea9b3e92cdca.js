This is useful but makes me see to keeping my\nwork-life balance. I do this simply — turn off all the applications running when I finish my working day\nin the evening. The only issue is not to forget to open them again next day. But this process can be automatized. :-)\n<excerpt/>\nThe most important is to run the applications which are in use by the other team members. For example, I a Jabber app\nhas to be running since the workday has started. The same goes for any other messenger.</p>\n<p>We here at AppGyver use <a href="https://www.flowdock.com">Flowdock</a>\nfor team communication. So I needed to be sure that it is open every morning.</p>\n<p>It turned out that this is doable on Mac with the native Calendar application. Let me show you how exactly.</p>\n<h3>Create a new event in the Calendar</h3>\n<p>I named mine “Run Flowdock”. Do not bother about the laptop being opened by the event time your are setting up. The\napplication can run in advance. My event has <code class="language-text">9:35</code> time.</p>\n<h3>Make your event repeated</h3>\n<p>This event should be repeated every week at the workdays.</p>\n<h3>Run the application</h3>\n<p>Now the most interesting thing. You can run any application using custom event alerts.</p>\n<p>Choose the last item in the <code class="language-text">alert</code> select, which is <code class="language-text">Custom</code>.</p>\n<p><img class="article__image" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4802/14441195.32/0_88921_7d53950e_L.png" width="300" height="500" border="0" title="" alt=""></p>\n<p>Once the next dialog is opened, choose <code class="language-text">Open file</code>.</p>\n<p><img class="article__image" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4813/14441195.32/0_88925_47986a79_M.png" width="300" height="167" border="0" title="" alt="">\n<img class="article__image" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5109/14441195.32/0_88924_ea39983e_M.png" width="300" height="162" border="0" title="" alt=""></p>\n<p>By <code class="language-text">file</code> they mean an applicaiton to be run. It is defined to be <code class="language-text">Calendar</code> by default but you can\nchoose another one.</p>\n<p><img class="article__image" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4810/14441195.32/0_88922_22d155c7_M.png" width="300" height="193" border="0" title="" alt=""></p>\n<p>Then, select the application needed in the Finder dialog. In my case it is Flowdock.</p>\n<p><img class="article__image" src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4809/14441195.32/0_88923_7597bf28_M.png" width="300" height="196" border="0" title="" alt=""></p>\n<p>Then, fix the time. 5 minutes before 9:35 is exactly half past nine. Let me remin you, this does not mean that\nyou need to be at work by this time and have your laptop opened. You can be riding a bus or even sleeping. The\napplication will run later, when you open your computer.</p>\n<h3>Drawback</h3>\n<p>Not ideal, indeed. If your calendar is synchronized with iPhone, it peeps by this time. The phone cannot run the\napplication, so it reminds you about the event with sound. But as <a href="http://varya.me/ru/posts/run-app-in-time-on-mac/#comment-1582219469">one of my friends\nsuggests</a> the workaround can be to create a\nseparate calendar for such event and not to synchronize it with other devices.</p>',fields:{slug:"en/posts/run-app-in-time-on-mac/",prefix:"",disqusIdentifier:"posts-run-app-in-time-on-mac-index-en"},frontmatter:{title:"Run on time (about Mac applications)",date:"12 September 2014",v2:!0,old:null,tumblr:null,meta:null,cover:null}},authornote:{id:"/Users/varya/WebDev/Personal/varya.github.com/content/parts/author.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",html:'<p><strong>Mr. Gatsby</strong> Proin ornare ligula eu tellus tempus elementum.
