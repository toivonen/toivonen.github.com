This is a mature but not yet\nimplemented idea. Although, a friend of mine <a href="https://iamstarkov.com/">Vladimir Starkov sometimes practises the same</a>.</p>\n<p>In this issue there are tips on organizing Google Calendar, nice project management addition for GitHub, Styleguide\nsolutions for React projects and a couple of good reads.</p>\n<excerpt/>\n<h2>Week numbers in Google calendar</h2>\n<p>In Finland, the week numbers are widely used. People easily make agreements on let’s say “the beginning on week 45”. For\nthis purpose and also for the actual weekly reports, I have subscribed for a special Google calendar\nwhich provides a small week number at the top right corner or every monday.</p>\n<p><img src="/posts/week-44-2016/CalendarWeekNumbers3.png"></p>\n<p>Here are the instructions:\n<a href="http://www.daimto.com/how-to-add-week-numbers-to-your-google-calendar/">http://www.daimto.com/how-to-add-week-numbers-to-your-google-calendar/</a>.</p>\n<h2>ZenHub — a GitHub issue tracker</h2>\n<p><a href="https://www.zenhub.com/">ZenHub</a> is an add-on, which makes different boards with columns on top of GitHub issues.</p>\n<p><img src="/posts/week-44-2016/zenhub-task-board.jpg"></p>\n<p>It looks like a competitor of embedded <a href="https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features">GitHub\nProjects</a> but with\nmore features.</p>\n<h2>React Storybook and React Styleguidist</h2>\n<p>In the project I have started on Monday, we faced the need to document React components. There were two candidates\namong the tools to use — <a href="https://getstorybook.io/">React Storybook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sapegin/react-styleguidist">React\nStyleguidist</a>. Both with their pros and cons.</p>\n<p>By now, we ended up with Styleguidist. Anyway, this is not a mature solution, and we can probably think back.</p>\n<p>The Storybook was super easy to install. However, it requires more typing for every story and does not read the props out\nof the documenting comments.</p>\n<p>The Styleguidist was a tricky thing to run. Everything goes smoothly at simple projects but this was not our case. There\nwere some difficulties with the pages wrapped into <code class="language-text">react-hot-loader</code> container. I solved it by introducing proper file\nstructure. We should have it anyway. Now, there is a dedicated folder for the components and we taught the Styleguidist\nto work with it.</p>\n<p>As a piece of advice to friends, I can give the following: try to reuse your normal webpack config and not to write another one\nin the <code class="language-text">styleguide.config.js</code> file. It will save you some time when changing the building process. This is our version:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="text">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">const siteWebpack = require(&quot;./webpack.config.js&quot;);\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  title: &#39;My Great Style Guide&#39;,\n  components: &#39;./src/components/**/*.jsx&#39;,\n  updateWebpackConfig(webpackConfig) {\n    siteWebpack.module.loaders.forEach(function(loader) {\n      webpackConfig.module.loaders.push(loader);\n    });\n    webpackConfig.postcss = siteWebpack.postcss;\n\n    return webpackConfig;\n  },\n};</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h2>How to Write a Git Commit Message</h2>\n<p>The article <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">How to Write a Git Commit Message</a> by Chris Beams has already\nturned 2 years but still actual. I have read it previously and try to follow. But I do not recollect me shring the link\nto it. So, here it is.</p>\n<h2>4 different kinds of React component style</h2>\n<p>Setting up a new project I have scanned a lot of recent articles about React. One of them is <a href="https://www.peterbe.com/plog/4-different-kinds-of-react-component-styles">4 different kinds of React\ncomponent style</a>. I had doubts if to put it in\nthis blog post or not because it did not tell me much new. On the other hand, it’s not a long read and finely summarizes\ndifferent kinds of React components.</p>',fields:{slug:"en/posts/week-44-2016/",prefix:"",disqusIdentifier:"posts-week-44-2016-index-en"},frontmatter:{title:"Week 44, 2016",date:"08 November 2016",v2:!0,old:null,tumblr:null}},authornote:{id:"/Users/varya/WebDev/Personal/varya-gatsby/content/parts/author.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",html:'<p><strong>Mr. Gatsby</strong> Proin ornare ligula eu tellus tempus elementum.
