In Finland, they use not post boxes but\nslots in doors, so it is possible to put A LOT inside. :-) What do we get?</p>\n<h4>Furniture catalogs</h4>\n<p>Almost every week one or two furniture shops have a sale. Catalogs tell us about it. As a result, we know what local\nmarket can offer and what are the discounts.</p>\n<h4>Tech shops catalogs</h4>\n<p>Tech shops are not so generous when it comes to sales, but it is still interesting to learn what they are offering.\nHowever, last times we bought a lot of home tech at Amazon. Since they started to offer free shipping to Finland, it is\ncheaper, and they have a better selection.</p>\n<h4>Pizza</h4>\n<p>We are living in a new and growing area where a lot of new businesses are opening. Mostly they are pizzerias which\nadvertise with brochures. Older businesses also send their advertisements to remind us that they still exist. Usually, a\nbrochure includes a menu and delivery information.</p>\n<h4>Supermarket catalogs</h4>\n<p>There is only one supermarket in our area. But we can reach others by bus or by car. Because of that, these different\nsupermarkets also compete to get our attention. They have the most colorful catalogs with a lot of delicious photos.</p>\n<h4>Department store catalogs</h4>\n<p>Department stores like Stockmann and Sokos are trying to attract with full-size magazines. Usually, they focus on\nfashion, perfume, and cosmetics even though they have other goods as well. Such magazines may contain samples of cream\nor perfume.</p>\n<h4>Toy shops catalogs</h4>\n<p>There is a lot of them before Christmas, people want to find good presents. Toy shops offer so many and so nice toys! I\nwish we had a half of that in our childhood.</p>\n<h4>Local newspaper</h4>\n<p>In the South of Espoo, we read Länsiväylä newspaper (West Lane). This is the name of the road from Helsinki to Hanko\nnear which there are our areas. This newspaper tells us about local news. Something like once again about out poor metro\nwhich is going to be opened. There are articles on different social topics and a lot of local advertisements. Reading\nsuch a newspaper is a very good way to know about businesses nearby. Sometimes, a newly opened restaurant publishes\nthere its discount coupon.</p>\n<p>You can save yourself from getting all these newspapers and catalogs. For that, you only need to put a table or a\nsticker which says “ei mainoksia, kiitos”, or “ei mainoksia vain lehdet” if you still want newspapers. But I would\nrecommend not to use such signs. We had it in our first apartment and did not get all of these. We were getting the\nnewspapers in shops and so learned something. But with all these “spam” we would have gotten much more information which\nis very much useful for integration. Also, reading the catalogs you can study Finnish.</p>\n<p><a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169282/view/649113?page=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/368754/14441195.53/0_9e799_197eb5d4_L.jpg" width="500" height="500" border="0"></a></p>\n<h2>Services</h2>\n<p>In a library, it is possible to borrow a laptop. Just beep with your library card, authorize on the touchscreen, and a\nlocker will be opened. It’s free. Library card is also free.</p>\n<p><a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169282/view/649111?page=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/962386/14441195.53/0_9e797_5df4c8cd_L.jpg" width="375" height="500" border="0"></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169282/view/649112?page=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/368754/14441195.53/0_9e798_a87e7b63_L.jpg" width="375" height="500" border="0"></a></p>\n<h2>Medicine</h2>\n<p>Getting most of the drugs here in Finland is only possible having doctor’s prescription. Such a prescription a patient\ncan get either from a public sector doctor or from a doctor in a private clinic. For many working folks, private clinic\noption is available as a part of the employer health insurance. In private clinics, it is possible to book times on the\nphone or on the Internet. In the capital area, there is a range of clinics, so that in urgent need there is no problem\nto see a doctor in a couple of hours. I especially appreciate that these clinics often located in large shopping centers\nwith parking lots. It makes very handy and safe to get there by car even given Finnish weather and possible bad health\ncondition.</p>\n<p>Both public and private doctors have access to the national wide prescription database, where they can place a new item.\nThe prescriptions are stored electronically and are available at all the pharmacies in the country. However, for patient\nawareness, the same prescription is also often given in a paper and includes instructions.</p>\n<p><a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169282/view/649109?page=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/931298/14441195.53/0_9e795_3133c05c_L.jpg" width="375" height="500" border="0"></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169282/view/649110?page=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/893240/14441195.53/0_9e796_6857d47f_L.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0"></a></p>\n<p>At the pharmacies, besides open shelves, there is also a prescription area. They take customer’s Kela-card (state\ninsurance identifier), search in the database and release the medicine. Together with drugs, they give a bill to be\ncarried to the cashier. Part of the cost lays on the state, part is customer’s own. Own expenses vary and depend on many\nfactors such as customer’s needs, wellness, and overall sum. Perhaps, I will discover the details later. :-)</p>\n<p><a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169282/view/649108?page=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/477594/14441195.53/0_9e794_2d67cec4_L.jpg" width="375" height="500" border="0"></a></p>\n<h2>In previous episodes</h2>\n<p>Interested?
