Together, they go through the iterative design process and build modular UI for the product. Teams implement a pattern library using React and optionally styled-components, and document it with Storybook. The exercise contains managing collaborative updates and keeping the code in sync with the design reality. By the end of the day, each team has the product ready, built with the help of their library, and driven by an effective process to ensure smooth updates.\n"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","4165599823"]}
