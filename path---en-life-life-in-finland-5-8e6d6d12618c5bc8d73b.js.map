One insurance liability, another one is optional and ensures the car. Liability insurance\\ncost depends on how many years of driving in Finland were without accidents. So, for the newcomers, it is initially\\nquite expensive, about €500 a year. In the case of no accidents every next year a driver gains 10% discount. 80% is\\nmaximum.\\nThe car insurance by default is also about €500. But besides liability insurance, here the discount can be as large as\\nthe insurance company wants, for example, 70%.

So, in here it is more important for a car to be less consuming. If\\npossible, I always choose larger roads and drive 80 km/h, this gives optimal consuming. This way, I get 5-6 liters to\\n100km.</p>\\n<p>If the car is bought with a loan, an owner needs special permission in case of driving abroad. It can be ordered by\\nphone and comes very fast by post. But its maximum time-length is 6 months. And every time it costs €40. This is a good\\nreason to pay the loan in advance.</p>\\n<p>And, of course, there is an annual tax. Its amount depends on how much CO<sub>2</sub> the car makes. Meaning, for older crappy cars\\nthe tax is higher. Also, diesel cars pay much higher tax but this is caused by another reason. For our Volkswagen Golf,\\nwe pay €187 per year. Similar diesel car tax would be about €600.</p>\\n<p>I recollected this because got a bill. By email. Actually, the bills come into special electronic system buy I set email\\nnotifications there.
