So, there is completely no objective reason to ask me questions like that. I was asked\nthis only because I am a woman.</p>\n<p>This is the first answer on “What is wrong?“. Asking a woman gender related questions because she is a woman is pushing\nher to represent her gender. However it was clear that my intention of speaking at the conference was to share my findings\nin programming and learn from another programmers. It had nothing to do with my gender.</p>\n<p>Then, this question could be to the point, if I were responsible for bad diversity situation in the industry. And I am\nobviously not. I did my part staying on stage and presenting the result of my work when being asked about the solutions\nto the problem which I did not cause.</p>\n<p>Another thing, that not being a social scientist I don’t have proper information to develop a good answer. So, the\nsituation may be described like “a speaker stays on stage in front of hundreds of people looking at her and gets a\nquestion which she clearly is not able to answer”. It is known in advance that I cannot provide any valuable respond to\nthis question. There would not be any useful information coming from me. The only result was that I was put into an\nawkward situation.</p>\n<p>The more relevant thing would be to ask a random female about what they know. For example, something about their\npersonal experience. However, I still do not suggest this, because questions like “What are the difficulties you faced\nas a female developer” are very often too personal to be answered on stage. I think that if not on stage but in a\nprivate conversation, I would not mind a question regarding my gender-in-tech experience.</p>\n<p>If for some reason you would like a random female speaker to answer a gender-equality question publically, it might be a\ngood idea to formulate it as much related to their work as you could. Something like “How do you solve diversity problem\n<strong>in your company</strong>?” would work better.</p>\n<p>So, the conclusion here is that the best way is not to have sexpectations (thanks my colleague Toni for the word) that\nfemale developers have knowledge in the diversity thing and even are interested in gender equality stuff.
