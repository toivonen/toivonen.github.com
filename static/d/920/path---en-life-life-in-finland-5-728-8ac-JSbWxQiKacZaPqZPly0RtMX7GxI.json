It is done by private companies, the\nprice is about €60. I don’t know if the price varies from car to car, but ours is about like that. If the check up is\nOK, they send a new document by post, and it is to be carried with when driving. If there is something to fix,\nre-checking is about €10. “Something to fix” might be lost studs. By the schedule, our check ups are always in winter.\nThose who have it in summer are lucky. :-) A check up takes 20-30 minutes.\nNew cars do not need these check ups in first 3 years.</p>\n<p>Also, there are insurances. One insurance liability, another one is optional and ensures the car. Liability insurance\ncost depends on how many years of driving in Finland were without accidents. So, for the newcomers, it is initially\nquite expensive, about €500 a year. In the case of no accidents every next year a driver gains 10% discount. 80% is\nmaximum.\nThe car insurance by default is also about €500. But besides liability insurance, here the discount can be as large as\nthe insurance company wants, for example, 70%. People look for offers in different companies and take the best.</p>\n<p>2 times a year we change wheels. Nor the tires but wheels with the needed tires, it’s faster.</p>\n<p>Also, parking by the house is paid, now it is €14 per month. There is also a place with free parking by our house, but\nhaving our own place feels safer.</p>\n<p>Petrol is expensive, now it is €1.5 per liter. So, in here it is more important for a car to be less consuming. If\npossible, I always choose larger roads and drive 80 km/h, this gives optimal consuming. This way, I get 5-6 liters to\n100km.</p>\n<p>If the car is bought with a loan, an owner needs special permission in case of driving abroad. It can be ordered by\nphone and comes very fast by post. But its maximum time-length is 6 months. And every time it costs €40. This is a good\nreason to pay the loan in advance.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there is an annual tax. Its amount depends on how much CO<sub>2</sub> the car makes. Meaning, for older crappy cars\nthe tax is higher. Also, diesel cars pay much higher tax but this is caused by another reason. For our Volkswagen Golf,\nwe pay €187 per year. Similar diesel car tax would be about €600.</p>\n<p>I recollected this because got a bill. By email. Actually, the bills come into special electronic system buy I set email\nnotifications there. Then, I can log into the system on the web or in the mobile app and deal with the messages. If such\nmessage is a bill and the system has parsed it, it gives a link to pre-filled bank payment. The only thing to do is to\npress a button.</p>\n<h2 id=\"culture\"><a href=\"#culture\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Culture</h2>\n<p>From my archive.
