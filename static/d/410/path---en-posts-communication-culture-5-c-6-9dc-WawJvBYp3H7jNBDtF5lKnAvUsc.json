Transparency is crucial to internal communication because it breeds trust, accountability,\nand open dialogue. If the team feels as though they are being left in the dark on certain matters, they may be afraid to\nask questions and share their thoughts on those matters. Not all information can be made available to everyone, of\ncourse, but maintaining at least some transparency can have tremendous effects on the harmony and rapport within the\ncompany. (Bovet, 2017 &#x26; Rozen, 2016)</p>\n<p>Although company information transparency is more mindset rather than policy, it is possible to increase it by following\nsome specific practices. According to many examples of success, information availability is much easier to achieve when\npracticing documenting. Active usage of documentation tools such as company wiki, tasks board, weekly mail lists etc\nmakes it much easier to find information. (Milinovich, 2008) Information availability contributes to overall company\nenvironment because it is connected to emotional ownership and at the same time is a source for innovative practices.</p>\n<p>Often happens, that management has arguments against transparency as they are afraid to overwhelm the employees. In this\nsense, it is important to remember that lack of information is often underestimated. However, by using right tools and\npractices, it is possible to provide information upon request. For example, for weekly sharing about projects, it is\npossible to use mailing lists (open for any employee to join) rather than direct emails. Cross-company chat solutions\nlike Slack, Flowdock or Microsoft Teams are even more flexible as they provide channels to join or not. (Bovet, 2017)\nThe freedom this approach provides also develops employees’ awareness of how they are trusted in the company, which in\nturn translates into employees’ engagement.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of good communication practices is openness. Allowing people to step out into the open and talk about how\nthey feel has both helped them bond and accept ownership over the company. (Milinovich, 2015) In most cases, in startup\nenvironment “karma” means more than an official title. Accordingly, in corporate organization, creative people should\nnot feel being limited by their official position and speak openly. This applies to both giving feedback and sharing\nideas. Speaking of feedback, it is needed to remember that getting feedback needs to be followed by actions. The best\norganizations are the ones that not only solicit constructive feedback but actually do something with it.\n(Milinovich, 2015)</p>\n<p>Unlike startups, corporate organizations tend to structure themselves. In many cases, these structures demonstrate\nstrong vertical connections but lack of horizontal connections. Such structure is quite an obstacle to any innovation\nprocess. Taking this fact into account, internal communication should concentrate on building cross-departmental\nconnections and other kinds of horizontal interactions. Company-wide conversations, whether they are organized as\nregular meetings and open forums or with a range of online communication tools, form special eco-system friendly to\ninnovation initiatives and processes. Besides sharing information, horizontal connections ensure cross-departmental\ncollaboration, which makes it possible for employees to act in uncertain environments like entrepreneurs do. (Rozen,\n2016 &#x26; Sarasvathy, 2008)</p>\n<p>External events are also a crucial part of company communication strategy. They provide an opportunity to develop\ninformal relationships and trust. Meeting outside the office changes the employees’ environment which reflects their\nperception of each other and their relationships. Combined with positive emotions such events bring, this contributes\ninto their micro-environments which, in turn, form the whole company ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h3>\n<p>Bovet C, (2017) <em>17 Internal Communications Best Practices for 2017</em><br/>\n<a href=\"https://blog.enplug.com/internal-communications-best-practices-2017\">https://blog.enplug.com/internal-communications-best-practices-2017</a></p>\n<p>Milinovich J.
