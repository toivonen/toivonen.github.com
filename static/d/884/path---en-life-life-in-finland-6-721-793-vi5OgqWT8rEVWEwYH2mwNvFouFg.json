It has\nalready started to seem as a joke. Not yet so funny as about Berlin airport but anyway the Finns have all the chances.</p>\n<p>The first thing to say, Helsinki has ony one metro line and its development means to prolong this line. There are no\neven talks about making other crossing lines, at least in the near future. At the moment, they are building the line\nfrom Helsinki city center to the west. Its length is 21 kilometer ans it is supposed to have 13 stations.</p>\n<p>The plan was to open the first half of the line, and later the second. Initially, this first part should be opened in\nautumn 2014 but in the middle of development, it became clear that the release had to be postponed. At some point, they\ndecided to announce the opening for August 2016. It was shouted everythere, the city changed the bus schedule and put\ninto about that at every bus stop. Then suddenly in June, there is information that they cannot make it and postpone to\nthe New Year. Then, to April 2017 and last time to September 2017.</p>\n<p>And now, again we got to know that nothing is ready and the new deadline is beginning of 2018.</p>\n<p>For me, the biggest surprise is that no one is sentensed.

There is little traffic, ferry companies will not be happy. And the metro line which\ncannot be opened yet is still the biggest construction project in Finland. Given this, a tunnel under the sea seems too\nmuch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169023/view/648232?page=0\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/872977/14441195.52/0_9e428_53071679_L.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>However, despite many other ideas when talks disappear after a while, information about the tunnel appears again and\nagain. When it turned out that Hyperloop Helsinki-Stockholm (yeah, we had such a project as well) most likely will not\nsucceed, all the attention was given to Helsinki-Tallinn again. “What if we build not auto and railway tunnel but a\nHyperloop?” I must say that this idea sounds valid. Unlike other Hyperloop locations, Helsinki-Tallinn direction has\nonly ferries and very expensive (if to calculate per kilometer) flights.</p>\n<p>And today’s news is that Espoo city has decided to step in and push the tunnel going through it. There are more and more\ntalks about the project, even EU says that it can finance something.
