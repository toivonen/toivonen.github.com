Together, they go through the iterative design process and build modular UI for the product.

By the end of the day, each team has the product ready, built with the help of their library, and driven by an effective process to ensure smooth updates.\n"}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"http://varya.me/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/design-systems/hands-on-workshop/","breadCrumbs":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Home"}}},{"node":{"id":"2a4ad179-3e97-56bd-8af5-c7cbed5d69ef","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/varya/WebDev/Personal/varya.github.com/content/pages/1--design-systems/index.md","fields":{"slug":"/design-systems/","prefix":"1","lang":"en","disqusIdentifier":"1--design-systems","level":1},"frontmatter":{"title":"Design systems","subTitle":null,"v2":null,"old":null}}},{"node":{"id":"678d18e2-94b3-5f21-8352-44bc01880d77","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/varya/WebDev/Personal/varya.github.com/content/pages/1--design-systems/hands-on-workshop/index.md","fields":{"slug":"/design-systems/hands-on-workshop/","prefix":"1","lang":"en","disqusIdentifier":"1--design-systems-hands-on-workshop","level":2},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hands-on with design systems","subTitle":"Intensive workshop for a multidisciplinary team or teams","v2":null,"old":null}},"last":true}]}}
