Even out of study context but in everyday life I have always been\ninterested in the answer to the question “What is so special about entrepreneurs that makes them who they are?”. Below,\nI have tried to summarize the knowledge I got and answer this question.</p>\n<excerpt/>\nVery interesting article by prof. Saras D. Sarasvathy introduces and explains the concept of “effectual thinking” as a\nspecial property of entrepreneurial mindset which affects entrepreneurs’ decision-making process and the way they\naddress problems and overcome challenges. Unlike causal thinking, the effectual thinking assumes set of given means\nrather than a specific goal to aim. Entrepreneurs are to act in an uncertain environment with plans to be made and\nre-made on the go rather than strategically articulated for a distant future like classic business schools teach to do.\n<p>In my opinion, many aspects of “effectual” thinking introduced by prof. Saras D. Sarasvathy very much reflect design\nthinking principles. Design thinking proposes a set of strategies to be used during the process of designing. As\nWikipedia suggests, this approach can be also used to resolve issues outside professional design practice.\nEntrepreneurs, consciously or not, are using design thinking in their domain.</p>\n<p>According to the design thinking, no “brilliant mind” is needed for a good idea but a creative and\nhuman-centered process. Similarly to that, many entrepreneurs cannot explain what is so special about them to achieve\nthe success. In many cases, their answers to the question can be shortened to “I just did it”. However, if to analyze\nthe strategies they are applying and way they form their social networks, we can find a lot of attributes of design\nthinking in all the aspects of an entrepreneurial experience.</p>\n<p>Applying design thinking, it is good to use a cycle of solving problems which starts from empathizing, is followed by\nideation and making a prototype with the next testing and implementing. (Brown, 2008) As prof. Saras D. Sarasvathy\npointed out, successful entrepreneurs tend to start from their familiar domain which matches emphasizing the problem.\nHowever, in many cases, with the following interaction, the solution or even the area may change completely.</p>\n<p>Prototyping and early releases are very much encouraged by the design thinking. It requires special strength to stop the\nimproving process and release. Besides the obvious advantage of meeting its users, early prototype ensures that its\ncreators will more likely provide changes according to the gotten feedback. If the release happens later and in a more\npolished way, the creators probably have the final vision of their product. This would make it harder for them to accept\nfeedback or to find innovative solutions to the problems which such feedback addresses. In the same way, successful\nentrepreneurs introduce their products and services as soon as possible, sometimes even before they are ready. It is\nalso possible because entrepreneurs feel the need to act in uncertainty by the appeared information, with plans to be\nmade and remade to reflect the changing environment. Often happens that such a strategy leads to the result never\npossible to achieve if using casual practices. Similar to designers, entrepreneurs experience the “a-ha moments” never\npossible to be planned in the classical business approach.</p>\n<p>Basics of effectual reasoning are that we do not need to predict the future in order to control it. Acting by this\nprinciple may face psychological issues as many people do not find it comfortable. Unlike them, entrepreneurs follow\nthis strategy and act according to the new information. Even though it looks like taking risks, in many cases it is\nself-controlled iterative problem-solving process exactly as design thinking suggests.</p>\n<p>However, the try-and-test approach can lead to a failure. But thanks to iterative nature of this process and early\nreleases, such failures occur earlier and at low levels of investment, which makes them affordable. Besides, failure as\nother unexpected stuff becomes a part of an entrepreneurial experience and transforms unpredicted into utterly mundane\nis the special domain of entrepreneur’s expertise. Matching this to design thinking paradigm, we must admit that\nentrepreneurs demonstrate growth mindset which makes failures not so frightening because they are the possibilities to\nlearn and sometimes look as the necessary part of the road to the success. (Edmondson, 2011)</p>\n<p>Successful entrepreneurs tend to win even when they fail also because of their ways to interact with people. While\nacting, entrepreneurs form a social network and strategic connections. In entrepreneurial experience, strategic\npartnership is one of the keys to the success. For example, often happens, that it opens the doors to the already taken\nmarkets which analytical market researches suggest not to enter.</p>\n<p>To be able to establish such partnership with the right people, entrepreneurs need to behave according to “giving\nculture” principles. Being givers, they are oriented to their own success but also help others along the road. These\nwin-win strategies help them to overcome their current challenge as well as form useful network of strategic connections\nand domain for future iterations and new projects. (Grant, 2013)</p>\n<p>As communication and networking are the major parts of the entrepreneurial experience, for entrepreneurs one of the most\nimportant things to do is to surround themselves with right people and lead them. A leader in this sense and according\nto the design thinking is not a manager but a champion of engagement. In practice, a leader contributes to vision and\nstrategy as well as makes sure that collaboration happens. Entrepreneurs lead people providing them with emotional\nownership in the goals and objectives. Similarly to how entrepreneurs form their market environment, they grow the right\npeople. (Paasonen, 2017)</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, as designers, entrepreneurs solve the problems and determining the future. No wonder, that the\nmethods and principles both use to achieve success are basically the same.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h3>\n<p>Sarasvathy S.
